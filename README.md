#### Article: [Why code reviews matter (and actually save time!)](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/software-development/code-reviews)

**My thoughts:** This article talks abouts the concept of *code review* and discusses how it contributes to
agile software develpoment. One part I liked about this article is how code review facilitates faster response to
an emergency bug fix. The article mentions that developers do not like to be "sole point of contact" on a piece of code. For example, I would feel uncomfortable if I am given the responsibility to fix a production code which I did not write and have little idea about what it does. Code review allows everyone in the team to know about each other's work. In this way anyone who is available during a misfortune can readily *(being agile)* start fixing the bug. Therefore, code review should never be neglected in an agile environment.  


**Santiago Rendon:** Another thing the article mentioned about the benefits of code review is that having teammates review your code uses peer pressure to the team's advantage. Basically, if a developer knows their code will be reviewed by the team then the developer is more likely to make his code as impecable as possible. This extra effort helps the project go smoothly with less bugs.
